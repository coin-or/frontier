"""Resolver-integrity regression gate for the skill product surface.

Skill content is the product surface: a guidance pointer or a `get_skill(section=…)` that
names a heading which doesn't resolve is a silent broken link, and the highest-frequency way
to introduce one is moving/renaming a section (e.g. during distillation). These checks are the
deterministic half of the regression gate (see .claude/plans/eval-baseline.md): they don't
prove behavior, they prove every referenced section still resolves and no heading collides.
