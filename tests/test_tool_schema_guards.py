"""Schema-level steering guards: the wrong-name params advertise their redirect.

The guard params (model.scenarios, solve.scenario/run_scenarios, explore.label)
are schema-valid by design — FastMCP silently drops unknown arguments, so each
guard must exist in the signature to catch its miscall. But an undescribed guard
param is an attractive nuisance: `run_scenarios: boolean` in the schema reads as
a flag and invites the very call it rejects (both 2026-07-10 demo-replay agents
made exactly these miscalls before the runtime guard corrected them). These
tests pin the fix — every guard param, and the merge-vs-replace contract on the
model data params, carries its steering description in the advertised
inputSchema — and gate it against an SDK upgrade dropping Field descriptions.
Assertions are keyword-level, not exact-phrase: wording may be polished freely
as long as the steering target / semantic stays named.

The runtime half of the constraints contract (count echo + shrink note) lives
with the other update-behavior tests in test_server.py::TestModelUpdate.
