"""Frontier MCP server: 4 tools (model, solve, explore, get_skill) + 4 skill resources.

Skill auto-injection: tool responses include the relevant skill content for
the *next* workflow phase, so agents always receive guidance at the right time
without needing to manually call get_skill().

Injection map:
  MCP connect (server instructions) → condensed problem_framing + constraint schemas
  model/create response             → data_collection skill
  model/update (objectives/options)  → data_collection skill (if not already injected)
  model/update (scores hit 100%)     → optimization_strategy skill
  solve/run response                → solution_interpreter skill (first solve per problem; re-armed by a structural edit)
  solve/validate (ready=true)       → optimization_strategy skill (if not already injected)

        "Multi-objective decision optimization toolkit. It helps the user make hard decisions with many options and conflicting goals (which projects to fund, how to split a budget, who to source from). Your role is translation: turn the user's decision into a model, run the optimizer, and read the results back in their terms. The optimizer does the math; the user keeps the framing and the final call.\n\n"
        "WORKFLOW. The user's decision moves through these phases; track which one they're in, drive its tools, and guide them to the next:\n"
        "  - FRAME → model/create + model/update (objectives, options, constraints, scenarios): translate the decision into the model.\n"
        "  - SCORE → model/update (the scores).\n"
        "  - EXPLORE → solve/run (approximate NSGA) [+ run_scenarios], then explore/tradeoffs [+ scenario_frontiers]: map the frontier broadly. Measure: coverage.\n"
        "  - CURATE → explore/curate: narrow to the handful the user would defend.\n"
        "  - CERTIFY → solve(solver=\"highs\"|\"cuopt\") then `explore certify`, on a supported shape (binary selection or mean-variance QP): prove the curated finalists, each optimal at its tradeoff. Measure: the optimality gap (dominance, coverage, the NSGA-never-dominates invariant, corner sharpening).\n"
        "  - EXAMINE → read the results back in the user's terms: `explore sensitivity` (the highest-leverage lever; continuous/QP duals), `explore scenario_results` (which picks survive the scenarios), `explore audit` (a guarantee over every feasible plan), `explore composition` (why this mix).\n"
        "  - DECIDE → the user commits; `explore curated` renders the handoff. The engine lays out the options and leaves the final call to them.\n"
        "The solve is embedded: approximate in EXPLORE, exact in CERTIFY (one optimizer, two passes). Iterate throughout: refine the model, re-solve, `explore compare_runs`.\n\n"
        "GOVERNANCE CHECK (optional, binary problems): `explore audit` reasons over the WHOLE feasible space, not just "
        "the frontier — prove a property holds for EVERY feasible plan (verdict 'holds', a guarantee) or get a concrete "
        "counterexample witness (verdict 'violated'); with no property it probes feasibility (the exact form of validate). "
        "Needs HiGHS; no prior solve required.\n\n"
        "LONG SOLVES RUN IN THE BACKGROUND: a slow solve/run (thorough, exact, or large) returns "
        "{status:\"running\", job_id} instead of blocking — poll solve(action=\"status\", job_id=...) until "
        "status=\"complete\". This is normal; narrate progress to the user between polls and never claim "
        "results while a solve is still running.\n\n"
        "GUIDANCE MAP — your durable index. Four canonical skills, one per phase:\n"
        "  - problem_framing — FRAME: objectives vs constraints, approach (binary/proportional), aggregation, scenarios.\n"
        "  - data_collection — SCORE: eliciting/estimating scores without anchoring bias, quality signals.\n"
        "  - optimization_strategy — EXPLORE / CURATE / CERTIFY: mode + solver choice (incl. the exact-certify flow), constraint strategy, infeasibility, iteration.\n"
        "  - solution_interpreter — EXAMINE / DECIDE: presenting tradeoffs (never 'best'), reading the certificate + exact sensitivity, curation, deciding.\n"
        "data_collection / optimization_strategy / solution_interpreter AUTO-INJECT (their core text) into tool responses at their phase transition. "
        "problem_framing does NOT — call get_skill('problem_framing') before the first model/create when framing isn't obvious.\n"
        "PERSISTENCE + DEPTH: each skill's deep, situational sections live in its references — NOT injected — and are fetched one at a time with "
        "get_skill(<name>, section=<heading>); decision responses name the exact section to fetch in their guidance_pointer. If you're deciding in a "
        "phase whose guidance you no longer have in view, RE-FETCH it (whole skill or one section) before acting — don't proceed from memory.\n\n"
        "## Pre-create framing checklist (read before model/create)\n"
        "Picking the right approach + aggregation upfront avoids a re-solve. Ask:\n"
        "1. Approach — does the user want to *select* options or *allocate* across them?\n"
        "   - Selection ('which K of N?') → `approach=\"binary\"`.\n"
        "   - Allocation ('how much of each?', distributing a fixed pool of capital/time/headcount) → `approach=\"proportional\"`.\n"
        "   - Portfolios usually mean allocation. If the user says 'portfolio' or 'diversified', default to proportional unless they explicitly say 'pick K'.\n"
        "2. Aggregation — for each objective, how do per-option scores combine into the objective's overall value?\n"
        "   - `sum` (default): additive quantities (revenue, cost, effort).\n"
        "   - `avg`: when the overall value is the weighted/equal average (return %, yield %, quality scores). Most rate-like objectives want avg, not sum.\n"
        "   - `min` / `max`: when the weakest/strongest member determines the overall value.\n"
        "   - `quadratic`: when value depends on pairwise interactions (portfolio variance/risk via covariance, synergy, redundancy). Requires `interaction_matrices` entries.\n"
        "3. Risk / volatility objectives — if the user mentions risk, volatility, variance, or diversification, the objective almost certainly needs `aggregation=\"quadratic\"` with a covariance (or interaction) matrix. Bare `sum` over per-option vol is wrong for portfolios.\n"
        "If any of these are ambiguous, call get_skill('problem_framing') for the full guide before create.\n\n"
        "## Scores Schema\n"
        "Flat list of triples: [{\"option\": \"<name>\", \"objective\": \"<name>\", \"value\": <float>}, ...]\n"
        "Upsert by (option, objective). Every option × objective combination must be scored before solve.\n\n"
        "## Objective Schema\n"
        "{\"name\": \"<name>\", \"direction\": \"maximize\"|\"minimize\", \"aggregation\": \"sum\"|\"avg\"|\"min\"|\"max\"|\"quadratic\"}\n\n"
        "## Key Rules\n"
        "- Scores merge (upsert); objectives / options / constraints use full replacement.\n"
        "- Never say 'best' — every Pareto solution is optimal at its tradeoff.\n"
        "- Use plain text. Emojis and decorative symbols add visual noise without conveying tradeoff information and undermine the analytical tone of decision presentation.\n"
        "- Do not narrate progress between tool calls. Tool calls and results are already visible to the user — extra prose like 'Now I'll batch the scores' or 'Let me fix that field' is noise. Speak only in the final response after the work is complete.\n"
        "- Constraint schemas: see the `model` tool docstring for the full set."

    Skill auto-injection: when an action triggers a skill, the response carries
    `_skill_guidance: {skill, reason, content}` — `content` is the full skill body
    inline, so no separate `get_skill()` call is needed once injected this session.
    Repeat calls suppress the injection (the skill is already in your context);
    structural changes re-arm it so the next phase delivers fresh guidance. For
    skills not auto-injected (e.g., `problem_framing` before `create`), fetch via
    `get_skill(<name>)`.

    Actions:
      create  — Start a new problem. Params: name?, domain?, context?, approach?,
                objectives?, options?, constraints? (all optional; add via update later).
                Scores, reference_points, scenario_config, and interaction_matrices are
                NOT applied at create — passing them errors with a pointer to update.
                `source` belongs to action='load' (it rebuilds a saved/example bundle),
                so passing it to create errors with a pointer there.
      update  — Modify problem. Params: problem_id (required), plus any of:
                name, domain, context, objectives, options, scores, constraints,
                approach ("binary" or "proportional"),
                reference_points (list of {type, name?, objective_values, selected_options?}),
                interaction_matrices (list of {objective, entries} for quadratic aggregation).
                Scores use merge semantics; everything else is full replacement.
                Side effects: score and structural edits both mark the latest run stale.
                Only structural edits (objectives/options/constraints/approach/matrices/scenarios)
                re-arm solution_interpreter — and, on an objectives/options shape change,
                optimization_strategy — so the next solve re-injects fresh guidance.
                Score-only updates re-arm nothing: iterate freely without re-paying guidance.
      get     — Problem state. Params: problem_id, section? (optional).
                Without section: the summary (counts + status flags — always small).
                With section: targeted slice. Valid sections:
                  summary, objectives, options, scores, constraints, matrices,
                  scenarios, run, runs, curated, references,
                  full (the complete dump — can exceed token cap for large models).
                Drill into the slice you need rather than pulling "full".
      list    — All problems. No params.
      delete  — Remove problem. Params: problem_id
                Side effects: deletes the problem and its run history; resets all skill-injection
                flags for the problem id.
      load    — Load a problem by name from the bundled examples or the user's saved
                library, in the portable examples format (problem.json + scores.json
                [+ solutions.json]). Params: source (the name, e.g. "facility_location").
                Resolves saved/ first, then examples/ — a saved problem shadows a bundled
                example of the same name. Registers a fresh problem in the store and returns
                its problem_id. Scenarios and prior results (when present) are restored.
                Omit source to list the available names.
      save    — Save a problem to the user's library (saved/<name>/) in the portable format,
                always including the current solutions when the problem has been solved.
                Params: problem_id, save_as? (the name; defaults to a slug of the problem name).
                The bundle round-trips back via `load`.

    Key guidance:
    - Objectives: 2-4 is the sweet spot. If >4, consolidate.
    - Ask "does quantity matter?" to choose binary vs proportional approach.
    - Classify carefully: "budget" might be an objective OR a constraint.
    - First formulation is a hypothesis — rough scores > no scores, fewer objectives > many.

    Schema reference: see the `problem_framing` skill (read it via
    `get_skill('problem_framing')` or before calling `model/create`) for
    constraint, interaction-matrix, and scenario JSON schemas.

    """Validate and run the optimizer.

    Skills auto-inject on phase completions: `optimization_strategy` when scores
    reach 100% or validation passes, `solution_interpreter` on the first solve
    per problem. See the `model` docstring for `_skill_guidance` shape and the
    once-per-problem throttle.

    Long solves run in the BACKGROUND. A `run`/`run_scenarios` that doesn't finish within a
    short inline budget (~10s — thorough, exact, or large problems) returns
    `{status:"running", job_id}` instead of blocking; poll `solve status` with that job_id
    until `status="complete"`, then you get the normal result. Fast solves still return inline.
    The solve always completes and persists in the background, so `explore` works once it's done.

    Actions:
      validate       — Check if problem is ready. Returns issues, missing scores, and the
                       available solvers (`solvers` block) for this environment.
      run            — Validate, then optimize. Returns the Pareto frontier (+ solution_interpreter
                       skill), OR a {status:"running", job_id} handle to poll (see above).
                       Side effects: archives the previous run; clears results_stale; persists full
                       results to full_result_path on disk.
      run_scenarios  — Run optimization independently per scenario. Requires scenario_config.
                       May also return a running handle to poll.
      status         — Poll a background solve by `job_id`. Returns status="running" (with
                       elapsed_s) until done, then the full solve result. A "stale" status means
                       the problem was edited mid-solve (nothing was overwritten) — re-run.

    Args:
      mode: "fast" (default) for quick exploration iterations, "thorough" for
            final convergence when the problem is refined. Adapts population size,
            generations, and operator parameters to problem complexity. Also selects
            NSGA-III for 4+ objectives.
      max_solutions: Cap the number of Pareto solutions returned (default 100).
            Useful for proportional mode which can produce large frontiers.
      seed: Optional RNG seed for reproducibility, echoed as `seed_used` on every
            run. Same problem state + same seed → the same frontier (in- and
            cross-process); omit it and a fresh seed is drawn and recorded. Vary
            seeds to check frontier stability; fix the seed to reproduce or share a
            result. For `run_scenarios`, the parent seed is propagated to each
            scenario (per-scenario `seed_used` derived via SHA-256 of scenario name
            + parent seed), so pinning the parent reproduces the whole run.
      solver: Which engine to run. Omit (or "nsga") for the default NSGA-II/III
            evolutionary search — it fits any problem shape and is the right choice for
            exploration and most runs. "highs" (CPU) or "cuopt" (GPU) select an OPTIONAL
            exact backend that solves each frontier point to optimality for its scalarization
            (optimal to a 0.1% gap, not heuristic; add `exact=true` to certify a zero MILP
            gap) — reach for it on a final/decision run over a supported shape
            (binary selection, a quadratic mean-variance portfolio, or a purely linear
            allocation), or to certify an EA frontier. If the requested solver isn't installed or the shape doesn't fit,
            this returns a clear error listing the available solvers — check `solve
            validate`'s `solvers` block first. The engine that ran is echoed as
            `solver_used`. See the optimization_strategy skill ("Exact Solvers").
      exact: Exact backends only — certify each MILP inner solve to a zero optimality gap
            instead of the default speed-oriented bounded solve. Slower; use when stakeholders
            need certified optimality. No-op on the always-exact QP and on the default NSGA path.
      scope: Exact backends, any supported shape (binary MILP / proportional QP/LP) — how to produce
            the exact overlay. "curated" (DEFAULT): progressively certify the existing NSGA `run` by
            exact-solving only its frontier points — the lean explore-then-certify path; run `solve run`
            first so there's a frontier to certify. "full": a full exact pass (the exact solver on every
            NSGA evaluation — an exact-*guided* search), for when you want exact optimization to drive
            the exploration too, not just certify it. Curated falls back to a full pass when no NSGA run
            exists yet. The mode that ran is echoed as `overlay_scope`.
      time_limit: Optional wall-clock cap in seconds for a `run`/`run_scenarios`. The search
            stops at the generation/scalarization budget OR this cap, whichever fires first; a
            capped run returns its best-so-far frontier flagged `time_limited` (on an exact run
            each returned point is still optimal for its scalarization — only coverage is partial).
            It bounds the main search (a strong bound, not a hard deadline: on an exact run a small
            bounded setup phase isn't counted). Omit for an uncapped run. Pairs with backgrounding:
            bound a long run, or keep cost predictable. Present a `time_limited` result as partial —
            don't claim full convergence.
      wait_seconds: How long to block inline for the solve before handing back a background job
            handle. Default ~10s. Pass 0 to get the handle immediately (for a known-long run, so
            you can keep talking to the user while it solves). The solve runs to completion in the
            background regardless of this value.
      job_id: For action="status" only — the id from a running solve's response.

    Key guidance:
    - Expect iteration: first run is exploration, not the answer.
    - Use "fast" while refining scores/constraints, "thorough" when finalized.
    - Long solves background and return {status:"running", job_id} — poll `solve status` until
      complete. This is normal. Narrate progress to the user between polls; never claim results
      while a solve is still running.
    - Default NSGA explores; opt into an exact `solver` for provable optimality on a final run.
    - If zero solutions: check cardinality constraints and objective bounds for conflicts.
    - After re-run: check explore/curated to see which curated solutions survived.
    - 5-10 solutions is healthy; very few = constraints too tight.

    `solution_interpreter` auto-injects on the first solve per problem (see the
    `model` docstring for `_skill_guidance` shape and the once-per-problem throttle).
    Structural `model/update` edits re-arm so the next solve re-injects.

    full_result_path: large-result actions (solutions detail=true, marginal_analysis detail=true)
    write a full JSON dump to disk; the path is in solve/run's response — reference it instead
    of re-requesting.
    content_signature: stable hash of a solution's selected options (and allocations for
    proportional problems); survives re-solves, so prefer it over solution_id when referencing
    curated solutions or recording feedback across runs.

    Actions:
      tradeoffs  — Frontier overview.
                   Returns: objective_ranges, key_tradeoffs, extreme_solutions
                   (per-objective best/worst IDs, keyed `extreme_<objective>`),
                   balanced_solution (ideal-point closest), inflection_point_candidates
                   (solutions where marginal tradeoff cost jumps sharply — diminishing
                   returns boundaries), frontier_shape, binding_analysis.
                   Optional: scenario.
      compare    — Side-by-side comparison.
                   Requires: solution_ids (2+ ints) — or signatures (2+ curated
                   content_signatures) to compare the curated set. Optional: scenario, detail.
      solutions  — Pareto frontier listing — or one solution's detail.
                   Default: compact list (solution_id + objective_values + content_signature).
                   Pass solution_id for single-solution detail (incl. reference-point analysis);
                   detail=true for the full list dump (selected_options, allocations).
                   Optional: solution_id, detail, scenario.
      feedback   — Record user feedback. Feedback links to content_signature (stable across runs)
                   and attaches to curated solutions.
                   Requires: solution_id OR content_signature.
                   Optional: rating (1-5), notes, stage.
      compare_runs — Diff two runs (criteria, frontier ranges, option coverage).
                   Default: current run vs the previous one ("what changed since my
                   last solve?"). Optional: run_ids (2+) for explicit historical runs.
      certify    — Audit the NSGA frontier against the exact overlay: dominance audit,
                   hypervolume coverage reclaimed, soundness invariant, per-objective corner
                   sharpening. No params (audits `run` vs `exact_run`; flow: solve →
                   solve(solver="highs"|"cuopt") → certify). Optional: run_ids (exactly 2,
                   one NSGA + one exact, order-free) for explicit historical runs.
      audit      — Witness / feasibility auditor (the feasibility-side sibling of certify): reason
                   over the WHOLE feasible space, not just the frontier. No params → feasibility
                   probe ("is any plan feasible under the current constraints?" — the exact form of
                   validate's pre-solve check; verdict feasible / no_feasible_plan). With
                   audit_property (a constraint-shaped dict, same vocabulary as model constraints) →
                   prove a guarantee: does the property hold for EVERY feasible plan (verdict
                   "holds") or here is a concrete counterexample (verdict "violated" + witness).
                   Binary problems; needs HiGHS. Reads the model directly — no prior solve required.
      scenario_results — Cross-scenario robustness: option_robustness (importance-ranked,
                   tiers core/common/marginal), scenario-specific options, expected values
                   (ideal-point), scenario_risk per objective (expected/worst/best/cvar), and
                   regret (minimax-regret per solution + minimax_choice).
                   Optional: cvar_alpha (float in (0,1), default 0.2).
      scenario_frontiers — Per-scenario Pareto frontiers overlaid: viz_data for the chart
                   surface's colored parallel-coordinates overlay; ASCII range table. No params.
      curate     — Pin a solution to the curated set — and manage existing pins.
                   Pin: solution_id (optional custom_name, notes, scenario).
                   Manage: remove=true unpins; rename="<name>" renames — both by
                   content_signature (stable across re-solves).
      curated    — List curated solutions (each with in_current_frontier survival flag,
                   feedback history, avg_rating). No params — or format="markdown"|"csv"
                   to render the raw handoff export instead of the list.
      marginal_analysis — Marginal rate analysis: cost-per-unit between adjacent solutions, inflection point detection.
                   Default: summary per pair (inflection, stats, top-5 steepest, truncated viz).
                   Pass detail=true for full rates array + untruncated visualization.
                   Optional: detail, scenario.
      sensitivity — Solver-exact duals: where_to_invest (shadow prices, ranked), near_misses
                   (reduced costs), capped_options, frontier_shadow_price_trend — anchored on a
                   reference solution (default balanced; solution_id overrides) and naming the
                   optimized_objective. Needs an exact continuous run (LP/QP); falls back to the
                   frontier-inferred binding analysis (tagged) on heuristic/MILP runs.
                   Optional: solution_id, scenario, source.
      composition — Mine the solution set: option selection rates (consensus vs distinctive),
                   co-occurrence, design principles, decision-space strategy clusters, and
                   feedback rules when ratings exist. Frontier-wide or a curated subset.
                   Optional: solution_ids, signatures, detail, source.

    Scenario param (optional):
      Pass scenario="<name>" to inspect a specific scenario's results instead of the base case.
      Works with: tradeoffs, compare, solutions, curate, marginal_analysis.
      Use scenario_results (no scenario param) for cross-scenario robustness analysis.

    Source param (optional):
      Selects the base-case frontier: "run" (default, NSGA) or "exact" (the exact_run
      overlay). Works with: tradeoffs, compare, solutions, curate, marginal_analysis.
      Ignored when scenario is set. Analytics results echo `frontier_source`
      ({run_id, solver, kind}) — trust that label over your request (a stale transport
      can drop `source`); a heuristic result flags exact_overlay_available when an
      overlay exists.

    Presentation judgment (never "best", extremes-first, preference elicitation, curation
    flow) lives in the solution_interpreter skill — injected on first solve; deep sections
    via get_skill('solution_interpreter', section=...).
