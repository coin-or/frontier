"""cuOpt inner-solve backend for Frontier's exact NSGA-scalarization engine.

The NSGA outer loop, genome decoding, seeding, and result marshaling live in
``solvers._scalarization`` and are shared with the HiGHS backend; this module supplies only
the **cuOpt-specific inner solves** (a GPU convex QP and a GPU MILP) plus a thin delegation.
cuOpt and HiGHS differ *only* in these inner solves.

This is **additive, reversible**: the engine routes here only when ``optimize(solver="cuopt")``
is requested for a shape ``solvers.exact_solver_fits`` accepts; cuOpt is imported lazily
*inside* each inner solve, so the module loads cleanly on a machine with no GPU (an actual
solve needs ``cuopt-cu12`` + a GPU, which is why the prototype runs in Colab); and the
engine's Run/Solution contract is preserved by the shared engine, so explorer / metrics /
store need no changes.

EA ↔ cuOpt decomposition: the EA individual encodes a scalarization parameter (the
epsilon-constraint return target, plus an asset-selection priority under a cardinality/group
cap), and cuOpt maps it to the optimal weights::

    EA individual → r_target → cuOpt: min wᵀΣw s.t. μᵀw ≥ r_target, Σw=1, w≥0 → w* → (risk, return)

On a convex QP this makes the EA a frontier *walker* (a plain epsilon sweep matches it); it
earns its keep once non-convex structure (cardinality / group caps) makes r_target→w*
multimodal, where the EA picks the support and cuOpt solves the continuous QP on it exactly.
