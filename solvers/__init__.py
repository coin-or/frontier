"""Pluggable solver backends for Frontier.

Each backend mirrors the engine's existing solve contract (same inputs, returns a
``Run`` of ``Solution``s in the identical shape) so it can be swapped in behind a
gate without any downstream changes. See ``cuopt_backend`` for the cuOpt QP spike
and ``highs_backend`` for the co-equal CPU exact backend.

This module is the **selection surface** the agent reaches through (via the ``solve``
tool's ``solver`` argument) and that ``engine.optimizer.optimize`` reaches through to
route a run. It owns two pure, dependency-light checks so both callers agree:

  * ``available_solvers()`` — which backends can actually run here (the exact ones
    depend on an optional import being present).
  * ``exact_solver_fits(problem)`` — whether a problem's *shape* is one the exact
    backends solve (binary selection, a quadratic mean-variance portfolio, or a
    purely linear proportional allocation).

Probing availability with ``importlib.util.find_spec`` keeps this importable with no
solver installed; the backends themselves import their solver lazily inside each
inner solve, so nothing here forces a GPU/`highspy` dependency on the default path.
