## Design Principle: Deterministic Guardrails + Human Judgment

Frontier's architecture separates what must be **deterministic** from what requires **human judgment** — the split that makes its optimization explainable and governable. Every component below sits on one side of this line.

- **Deterministic guardrails (engine layer).** Computed from problem state, not model output, so the same inputs always yield the same result. Hard-constraint enforcement during search (`optimizer.py`, 8 constraint types — never violated); Pareto dominance filtering (NSGA-II/III); seeded reproducibility (`seed` / `seed_used` — same inputs + seed reproduce the exact frontier, in- and cross-process; `optimizer._seeded_rng_fallback` makes pymoo's otherwise-unseeded survival/selection RNG deterministic); pre-solve constraint-conflict validation (`optimizer._check_constraint_conflicts`); infeasibility analysis with relaxation suggestions; and frontier quality gates (`metrics.frontier_quality` → GOOD/WARNING/POOR). `metrics.py` states the contract directly: "deterministic signals from problem state … not LLM-generated."
- **Human judgment (agent + skills layer).** The skills steer the two calls that stay with the human — *framing* (objectives vs. hard constraints) and *selection* (which non-dominated solution to commit to). `solution_interpreter` enforces "never say best" and **traceable claims**: every quantitative statement must trace to returned data (a score, an objective value, a shadow price, a dominance relation), so a stakeholder can audit the reasoning line by line. Curation is the human's act of choosing; the engine records it but never makes it.

**Tighter optimality is an optional tier of the same determinism.** The default NSGA path is deterministic and reproducible but *heuristic* — it approximates the frontier. On supported problem shapes the agent can elect an exact-solver backend ([§ Solver Backends](#solver-backends-pluggable)) that makes each frontier point *optimal to a 0.1% gap* (a certified zero gap with `exact=true`) rather than approximate — a stronger form of the engine-side guarantee. Choosing *when* to pay for that **exact pass** is itself the human/skill judgment (the `optimization_strategy` skill guides it); the exact run, once elected, is deterministic. So exact solvers don't add a third layer — they deepen the deterministic guardrail and hand the agent one more judgment call.

The layers in §2 realize this split: the **Engine Layer** is the deterministic core, the **Skills** are the judgment scaffold, and the **MCP Tools** are the interface between them. Read the rest of this document through that lens.

## Tools & Skills Reference

### MCP Tools

Frontier exposes 4 tools — 3 domain tools with multiple actions, plus a skill delivery tool:

| Tool | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **model** | `create` | Start a new optimization problem (name, domain, context, approach) |
| | `update` | Add/modify objectives (2–7), options, scores, constraints, reference points, scenarios. Merge semantics for scores; full replacement for everything else. Marks results stale on structural changes. |
| | `get` | Return problem state. Optional `section` param for targeted slices: summary, objectives, options, scores, constraints, matrices, scenarios, run, runs, exact_run, curated, references. Without section: full dump. |
| | `list` | List all problems with metadata snapshots |
| | `delete` | Remove a problem and its data file |
| | `save` | Save a problem to the user's library (`saved/<name>/`) in the portable examples format. Params: `problem_id`, `save_as` (name; defaults to a slug of the problem name). Always includes `solutions.json` when the problem has a run. |
| | `load` | Load a problem by name in the portable format, resolving `saved/` first then bundled `examples/` (a save shadows a like-named example). Mints a fresh `problem_id`, registers it in the store, restores scenarios + prior results. Omit `source` to list available names. |
| **solve** | `validate` | Pre-flight check: ≥2 objectives, ≥3 options, complete score matrix, feasible constraints. Also returns a `solvers` block — which engines are `available` in this environment and whether the optional exact backends `exact_fits_shape` for this problem — so the agent can make an informed `solver` choice. |
| | `run` | Validate then optimize. Returns compact result — `objective_ranges`, `preview` (per-objective extremes + balanced solution by id/objective_values only), `quality`, `seed_used`, `total_pareto_found` (pre-pruning count), `frontier_complete` (bool — true when returned set is the full Pareto frontier, false when pruning truncated it), `frontier_quality` (status GOOD/WARNING/POOR with progressive gates and issues), `metrics`, `full_result_path` (disk path to complete JSON with all solutions — preferred for bulk export or artifact assembly), and `next_steps` pointer. Full solution detail also retrievable via `explore solutions` / `explore solution <id>`. Optional `mode`: "fast" (default, quick iterations) or "thorough" (final convergence). Optional `max_solutions` caps Pareto set size (default 100). Optional `seed` (int) for reproducibility (same inputs + seed → same frontier; echoed as `seed_used`); omitted = fresh random seed drawn and echoed. Auto-selects NSGA-II (2-3 obj) or NSGA-III (4+ obj). Parameters adapt to solution space size and objective count. Optional `solver` selects the engine — default NSGA (evolutionary, any shape) or an opt-in exact backend `"highs"`/`"cuopt"` (each frontier point optimal to a 0.1% gap on supported shapes, zero-gap with `exact`; see *Solver Backends*); the engine that ran is echoed as `solver_used`. Optional `exact` (bool) certifies each **MILP** inner solve to a zero gap (no-op on the always-exact QP and on the default NSGA path). A requested exact solver that is uninstalled or ill-fitting returns a clear error rather than silently falling back. **Long runs execute in the background** (see *Long-running solves*): the response is either the compact frontier result (fast solves, unchanged) or a `{status:"running", job_id}` handle to poll via `solve status`. Optional `time_limit` (s) caps wall-clock — the run stops at its budget or the cap, whichever first, returning a best-so-far frontier flagged `time_limited` (echoed on the result). Optional `wait_seconds` tunes the inline wait before a handle is returned (0 = return a handle immediately). |
| | `run_scenarios` | Independently optimize each scenario with score overrides/adjustments. Accepts optional `mode`, `max_solutions`, and `seed` (per-scenario seeds are deterministically derived from the parent so each scenario reproduces while starting from a distinct initialization), plus `time_limit` / `wait_seconds`. Also background-dispatched, same as `run`. |
| | `status` | Poll a background solve by `job_id` (from a `run`/`run_scenarios` that returned `status="running"`). Returns `status="running"` (with `elapsed_s` + a `label`) until the solve finishes, then the full solve result (with the `solution_interpreter` skill, injected once per problem at delivery). A `status="stale"` result means the problem's solve-inputs were edited mid-solve — nothing was overwritten; re-run. |
| **explore** | `tradeoffs` | Frontier overview: total solution count, objective ranges, correlations + normalized MI per pair (MI computed when n≥15), extremes, balanced solution (ideal-point closest), inflection-point candidates (diminishing-returns boundaries), frontier shape classification per conflicting pair (linear / concave / convex / discontinuous, with confidence), binding_analysis (shadow-price rates per binding constraint — how much each objective shifts per unit of slack relaxation, derived from frontier; objective_bound / cardinality / group_limit), objective_redundancy (classification per pair using Pearson + MI, flags Pearson/MI disagreement = non-linear dependence), vs references. Optional `scenario` param targets a specific scenario's frontier; optional `source="exact"` retargets analysis at the `exact_run` overlay instead of the default NSGA `run` (threaded through compare / solutions / solution / curate / marginal_analysis too). Every analytics result (tradeoffs / compare / solutions / solution / marginal_analysis) echoes `frontier_source` (`{run_id, solver, kind: heuristic\|exact}`) so a dropped or omitted `source` can't pass a heuristic frontier off as exact; a heuristic frontier served while an exact overlay exists also flags `exact_overlay_available`. |
| | `sensitivity` | Solver-exact duals from an exact continuous (QP) run: `where_to_invest` (constraint shadow prices, ranked — marginal objective change per unit relaxed) + `near_misses` (unheld options by reduced cost, closest first) + `capped_options` + `frontier_shadow_price_trend`, anchored on a reference solution (default balanced; `solution_id` overrides). The *exact* counterpart to `binding_analysis`; falls back to the frontier-inferred binding analysis on heuristic/MILP runs. Tagged `source=solver_exact｜frontier_inferred`; continuous/QP only (integer/MILP solutions have no exact duals). |
| | `compare` | Side-by-side comparison of 2+ solutions (shared/differentiating options, tradeoff summary). Optional `scenario` param. |
| | `solutions` | Pareto frontier listing. Default: compact (solution_id + objective_values + content_signature). Pass `detail=true` for full dump including selected_options and allocations. Optional `scenario` param. |
| | `solution` | Single solution detail with reference point analysis. Optional `scenario` param. |
| | `feedback` | Record user feedback: solution_id or content_signature, rating (1-5), notes, stage. Links to content_signature (stable across runs) and attaches to matching curated solution. |
| | `compare_runs` | Diff run history: criteria changes, frontier diffs, option coverage |
| | `certify` | Audit the exploratory NSGA frontier against the exact overlay. **No params**: audits the current `run` against the `exact_run` overlay (solve, then solve with an exact solver, then certify). Optional `run_ids` = exactly two (one NSGA + one exact, order-free — exact auto-detected by its solver) override with explicit historical runs. Returns a solver-agnostic certificate: `dominance_audit` (which NSGA points an exact solve dominates + fraction), `coverage` (hypervolume the overlay reclaims over NSGA — `reclaimed_fraction`), `invariant` (NSGA never dominates an exact point), `corner_sharpening` per objective (exact vs NSGA best, status sharpened/matched/under-sampled, is_risk_corner), `headline_corner`, and a `recommendation`. See *Solver Backends*. |
| | `scenario_results` | Per-scenario analysis with frequency-weighted option importance. Returns option_robustness sorted by importance (avg_frequency x avg_weight) with tiers: core (>50% in all scenarios), common (>25%), marginal (<25%). Also: scenario-specific options, expected values (ideal-point, probability-weighted), scenario_risk per objective (expected / worst_case / best_case / cvar_<alpha>%). Optional `cvar_alpha` (float in (0,1), default 0.2) sets the CVaR tail fraction. |
| | `scenario_frontiers` | Per-scenario Pareto frontiers overlaid for visualization. `viz_data` colors each scenario's frontier for the web UI's parallel-coordinates overlay and emphasizes curated picks (bold, colored by the scenarios they're feasible in); ASCII surfaces a per-scenario objective-range table. Shows how the achievable tradeoffs shift across futures. |
| | `curate` | Add a solution to the curated set with custom name and notes. Optional `scenario` param for curating from scenario frontiers. |
| | `uncurate` | Remove a solution from the curated set by content signature |
| | `rename_curated` | Update a curated solution's custom name |
| | `curated` | List all curated solutions with `in_current_frontier` survival flag |
| | `export_curated` | Export the curated set as a formatted handoff artifact: markdown table (default) or CSV (`format="csv"`). Columns: name, content_signature, objective values, selected_options. Invalid format errors cleanly. |
| | `compare_curated` | Compare curated solutions side-by-side by content signature. Default: compact (shared/differentiating options + objective values). Pass `detail=true` for full selected_options and allocations per solution. |
| | `marginal_analysis` | Marginal rate analysis: cost-per-unit between adjacent solutions, inflection point detection (where marginal cost jumps sharply). Default summary; `detail=true` for per-pair breakdown. Optional `scenario` param. |
| **get_skill** | *(single action)* | Retrieve workflow guidance by name. Returns full skill markdown. Works with all MCP clients (unlike resources, which require client-side resource support). Available skills: `problem_framing`, `data_collection`, `optimization_strategy`, `solution_interpreter`. |

**Rendering surfaces.** `explore` actions (and `model get` summary) emit both an ASCII `visualization` for chat / coding-agent clients and a structured `viz_data` payload for chart-rendering surfaces. The web UI renders `viz_data` via Plotly: frontier solutions adapt to dimensionality (2 obj → 2D scatter, 3 → 3D scatter, ≥4 → parallel coordinates, with a scatter⇄PC toggle), scenarios overlay as colored parallel coordinates with curated picks emphasized, and the formulation renders as a typed card. Clicking a point (or brushing parallel coordinates) curates it through the agent.

### MCP Skills (Resources + Tool)

Skills are available two ways for maximum client compatibility:
1. **`get_skill` tool** (universal) — works with any MCP client. Call `get_skill('problem_framing')` etc.
2. **MCP resources** (backward compat) — `frontier://skills/*` URIs, for clients that support resource reads.

Skills provide domain guidance the agent consults at each workflow stage:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **problem_framing** | Translate decision language into objectives/options/constraints. Covers objective vs constraint classification (principle-based, not keyword matching), hidden objective detection, approach selection (binary vs proportional — "does quantity matter?"), aggregation modes (canonical definition — sum/avg/min/max/quadratic), interaction matrices for quadratic aggregation, reference points, scenario definition, question anchors for guiding problem exploration. Cross-referenced by other skills. |
| **data_collection** | Guide score elicitation. Covers data readiness levels, anchoring techniques, batch efficiency, source evaluation, conflict resolution, score quality signals (variance, scale mismatch), aggregation implications on scoring (cross-references problem_framing), completeness drive. |
| **optimization_strategy** | Drive solve progression. Covers iteration expectations, validate→run→examine flow, constraint strategy (cross-references problem_framing for types), infeasibility response, binding constraint detection, curated solution survival tracking, run comparison, scenario interpretation, stale results and re-run judgment. |
| **solution_interpreter** | Present results without bias. Core Judgment (always apply): "never say best", five explanation dimensions, presentation order (Extremes → Balanced → Inflection → Risk → Preference), tradeoff framing, objective ranking elicitation, dominance explanation, question anchor (connect results back to user's original decision question). Presentation Refinements (situational): visualization, run diffs, reference point narration, scenario presentation, diagnostics, preference learning, curation guidance. Reference: `references/explore-diagnostics.md` for detailed field schemas of tradeoff and scenario result blocks. |

### Problem Persistence: Live Store vs Portable Bundles

A problem persists two ways: the **live store** (`store.py` → `data/{problem_id}.json`) holds the full canonical `Problem` keyed by UUID (session state — a stateful deployment just mounts a disk here); writes go through an **atomic** `save` (temp file + `os.replace`), so a concurrent reader never sees a half-written file and a background solve worker can persist without tearing a foreground edit (see *Long-running Solves*). **Portable bundles** (`problem_io.py`, the `model save` / `load` format the [`examples/`](examples/) use) split it across `problem.json` (definition), `scores.json` (data), and `solutions.json` (results, written when solved). `save` writes to a gitignored `saved/` library; `load` resolves a name against `saved/` then `examples/`, minting a fresh `problem_id`. `problem_io` is also where the examples' top-level `scenarios` list is bridged to `scenario_config` (`enabled=True`) — a naive `Problem(**problem_json)` would drop scenarios, since the field is `scenario_config` and pydantic ignores unknown keys.

### Solver Backends (Pluggable)

The default solve path is pymoo's NSGA-II/III for all problem shapes. Two **opt-in exact-solver backends** sit alongside it as an **optional audit / certification layer** over that heuristic exploration, gated so the default path never imports either (each imports its solver lazily, so the modules load whether or not that solver is present). Both share **one NSGA-scalarization engine** ([`solvers/_scalarization.py`](solvers/_scalarization.py)): NSGA-II evolves epsilon-constraint scalarization targets — and, under a cardinality/group cap, an asset-selection priority vector — while an injected **inner solver** solves each scalarized single-objective problem to optimality, and the Pareto frontier is assembled from those exact inner optima. NSGA explores the scalarization space; the inner solver makes each evaluated point optimal to a 0.1% gap instead of heuristic. The two backends differ **only** in that injected inner solve, and both return the engine's exact `Run` / `Solution` shape — so explorer, metrics, and store need zero changes. Additive, gated, reversible. In OR terms this is the *sequential-collaborative* matheuristic pattern — the heuristic explores, the exact solver certifies — reusing the same optimality-gap-against-a-bound a MILP solver already reports for its own incumbent, here applied across a Pareto front rather than a single objective.

**The exact run is an auditor, not a replacement.** Because each inner solve is optimal for its scalarization, overlaying exact points on the heuristic frontier can only **confirm or improve** it, never worsen it — the invariant *NSGA never dominates an exact point* (strict for the MILP, which is integer by construction; for the QP, rare violations can only come from integer-rounding the continuous optimum to whole-percent allocations, and are reported as such, not as a heuristic win). In practice exact does three things: it **sharpens the convex risk/variance corner** — the flat convex bowl where heuristics wobble and a QP is exact, i.e. the minimum-risk portfolio a risk-averse decider hinges on (min-volatility, most-diversified sourcing, firmest grid); it **audits heuristic slack** by flagging NSGA points shown as efficient that an exact solve dominates; and on a binary MILP it returns the **optimal subset** for its targets (to a 0.1% gap, certified zero-gap with `exact=true`). Where exact instead looks "short" of NSGA at a linear extreme, that's the EA's epsilon-target sampling budget — a denser sweep or targeted solve closes it — not a capability limit.

**Agent-selectable per run (provable optionality).** Solver choice is a **per-run decision made by the agent** — there is one selection mechanism, the `solver` argument, no deployment-wide env toggle. Solver choice is problem-shape- and workflow-phase-dependent (explore with the EA, certify a finalized pick with an exact solver), so a global default would fight that flow rather than help it. `solve(solver="highs"|"cuopt", exact=…)` threads through `optimizer.optimize(..., solver=…)`; omitted (or `"nsga"`) runs the default evolutionary search. [`solvers/__init__.py`](solvers/__init__.py) owns the two pure checks both the tool and `optimize()` consult — `available_solvers()` (probes importability with `importlib.util.find_spec`, so it answers without importing the solver) and `exact_solver_fits(problem)` (the shared shape gate, one scope for both backends: **binary selection** with every objective `sum`-aggregated — the MILP is linear in the 0/1 vars, so `avg` (fractional over a variable-size pick), `min`/`max`, and `quadratic` (nonlinear) are each declined *with a redefine hint* rather than silently optimized as a sum; or **proportional mean-variance** — a **minimize**-direction `quadratic` *risk* objective backed by an interaction matrix alongside `sum`/`avg` linear objectives, with `min`/`max` (nonlinear) and a *maximize* quadratic (non-convex) declined). The `solve` tool guards on both before running and returns an actionable error if the requested solver is uninstalled or ill-fitting — it never silently degrades to NSGA, so a result that claims optimality always ran an exact engine. Every run records `Run.solver` / `Run.exact` and echoes `solver_used` in the response, keeping the frontier traceable to the engine that produced it (the same "traceable claims" contract the skills enforce). The `optimization_strategy` skill's *Exact Solvers* section carries the agent-facing workflow guidance: when to upgrade from EA exploration to an exact-audited frontier, and how to narrate it without over-claiming.

The two backends are **first-class and co-equal** — the same auditor engine over two inner solves, one GPU and one CPU; pick by the hardware on hand, not by tier.

- **NVIDIA cuOpt** (`solvers/cuopt_backend.py`, `solver="cuopt"`) — the **GPU exact backend**: a convex min-variance **QP** for proportional mean-variance portfolios and a 0/1 **MILP** for binary selection. The QP has two equivalent builds — the term-by-term high-level `Problem` API (`_solve_qp_cuopt`, GPU-verified) and a scalable matrix `data_model` / CSR build (`_solve_qp_cuopt_matrix`) that drops the O(n²) Python-expression construction for a dense covariance to one vectorised conversion; both pack the same covariance, so they return the same optimum (the `_USE_MATRIX_QP` flag selects, default off pending GPU confirmation). Needs `cuopt-cu12` + a GPU, so it runs in Colab. cuOpt MILP solves run in **deterministic mode** (`CUOPT_MIP_DETERMINISM_MODE`) — the mode Frontier's seeded-reproducibility contract needs (cuOpt's default *opportunistic* mode can return a different optimum run-to-run), which as a side effect takes the *sequential* LP root relaxation: the epsilon sweep proposes infeasible corners the engine expects (scored dominated), and cuOpt's *concurrent* root solve aborts the process (`std::terminate`, an uncatchable kernel crash) on an infeasible relaxation, whereas the sequential path returns `Infeasible` as a clean `ok=False` like HiGHS — a configuration fix, not a workaround.
- **HiGHS** (`solvers/highs_backend.py`, `solver="highs"`) — the **CPU exact backend**: the same engine with HiGHS inner solves. Exact **MILP** for binary selection with additive (`sum`) objectives (every Frontier combinatorial constraint — cardinality, force in/out, dependency, exclusion, group limit, objective bound — is linear-integer, handled exactly; the [`capital_project_selection_120`](examples/capital_project_selection_120) showcase) and convex **QP** for mean-variance portfolios (linear `sum`/`avg` objectives plus the quadratic risk term). HiGHS can't solve MIQP, but never has to: under a cardinality/group cap the EA picks *which* assets are eligible and HiGHS solves the continuous QP on that support exactly. The solver is a plain `pip install highspy` (CPU, cross-platform, no special index, no GPU), so the exact path — and the shared NSGA engine with it — runs and is tested on the same machine as the engine ([`tests/test_highs_backend.py`](tests/test_highs_backend.py)).

Both backends accept `optimize(..., exact=True)` to certify each MILP inner solve (zero gap) instead of the default speed-oriented bounded solve. The independent scalarizations can also run concurrently through a thread pool (`_parallel_solve`, solver-agnostic — cuOpt releases the GIL during its GPU solve, HiGHS during its CPU solve), the DIY `concurrent.futures` pattern that cuOpt's deprecated `BatchSolve` now points to. The matrix QP build and parallel solve are exercised, measured, and compared against HiGHS in the [`exact_solver_comparison`](examples/exact_solver_comparison) showcase (dense-QP-at-scale and parallel-throughput panels); the CPU-checkable parts are covered by [`tests/test_cuopt_matrix.py`](tests/test_cuopt_matrix.py).

**Certifying a heuristic frontier against exact.** `engine.explorer.certify_against_exact(problem, nsga_run, exact_run) -> dict` ([`engine/explorer.py`](engine/explorer.py)) makes the auditor framing a concrete, returnable artifact: it overlays an exact run on an NSGA run of the same problem and returns a certificate with four parts — a **`dominance_audit`** (`nsga_dominated_by_exact`, `nsga_dominated_fraction`, `examples` — the heuristic slack exact catches), a **`coverage`** block (`reclaimed_fraction` / `exact_reclaims` — the hypervolume the overlay reclaims over NSGA alone, the magnitude behind the dominance count, normalized against a shared reference so it is fair to both fronts and grows with problem size), the **`invariant`** (`holds`, `exact_dominated_by_nsga`, `note` — confirming NSGA never dominates an exact point, with the QP integer-rounding caveat surfaced in the note rather than asserted away), and **`corner_sharpening`** per objective (`nsga_best`, `exact_best`, `improvement`, `status` ∈ `sharpened` | `matched` | `under-sampled`, `is_risk_corner`), plus a `headline_corner` and a plain-language `recommendation`. The certificate is scoped to *per-scalarization optimality + dominance + coverage* — deliberately **not** a proof that the whole frontier is optimal (no single optimum exists for a true multi-objective problem); the invariant is a soundness check on the overlay, not an independent quality score. It is surfaced as the MCP **`explore certify`** action. An exact solve is stored as the **`exact_run` overlay** (`Problem.exact_run`) *alongside* the exploratory NSGA `run` — never replacing it, and separately explorable via `explore … source="exact"` — so the "explore with the EA, then certify" flow needs **no params**: `certify` audits the current `run` against `exact_run` (two explicit `run_ids`, order-free, override that). The certificate is **solver-agnostic** (identical on HiGHS or cuOpt). Covered by [`tests/test_certify.py`](tests/test_certify.py).

### Skill Auto-Injection

Tool responses include the relevant skill content for the *next* workflow phase, so agents receive guidance at the right time without manually calling `get_skill()`. This is the primary delivery mechanism — `get_skill` exists as a manual fallback.

| Trigger | Injected Skill |
|---------|---------------|
| MCP connect (server instructions) | Condensed `problem_framing` + constraint schemas + scores schema |
| `model/create` response | `data_collection` |
| `model/update` (objectives/options) | `data_collection` (if not already injected) |
| `model/update` (scores hit 100%) | `optimization_strategy` |
| `solve/validate` (ready=true) | `optimization_strategy` (if not already injected) |
| `solve/run` response | `solution_interpreter` (first solve per problem; re-armed by a structural edit) |

Re-injection of `optimization_strategy` only fires on problem *shape* changes (objectives or options). Refinements (constraints, interaction_matrices, scenarios, reference_points, approach flip, score updates) don't re-trigger — the methodology guidance hasn't changed.

### Visualization & Compaction Layers

**Built-in visualizations** — `explorer.py` renders ASCII/text visualizations inline with explore results, avoiding a separate rendering step:
- `_render_tradeoffs_viz` — scatter plot of objective pairs with labeled extremes
- `_render_parallel_coords` — parallel coordinates chart for compare and compare_curated
- `_render_scenario_viz` — robust vs scenario-specific option summary
- `_render_marginal_rates` — cost-per-unit bar chart with knee marker

**Structured viz payloads (`viz_data`)** — alongside the ASCII, each explore view also attaches a JSON `viz_data` block (built by `explorer.py`'s `_viz_data_*` helpers) for hosts that can render charts. Six types: `scatter` (tradeoffs), `parallel_coords` (solutions / compare), `marginal_rates` (marginal_analysis — one per objective pair, under `pairs[]`), `scenario_summary` (scenario_results), `scenario_parcoords` (scenario_frontiers — per-scenario overlay with curated picks emphasized), and `formulation` (`model get` summary). Chat and coding-agent surfaces ignore the field and render the ASCII; the web UI (§5) consumes it and renders charts — Plotly for the frontier scatter/3D and the scenario overlay, D3 for the compare parallel-coords and marginal rates. The Python builders and the web UI's TypeScript types (`ui/lib/viz-data.ts`) are kept field-for-field in sync.

The `scatter` payload also carries **exact-certification** so the chart can denote it (built by `_scatter_exact_layer`, mirroring the `frontier_source` provenance + dominance logic): a `provenance` block (`kind` heuristic vs exact, `solver`, `exact_certified`) on every frontier, and — on a heuristic base-case frontier that has an `exact_run` overlay — an optional `exact_overlay` block (the certified `points` to draw on top, plus the heuristic `dominated_ids` the exact front strictly beats), with the objective ranges widened to keep a sharpened exact corner in-frame. The overlay is gated by the same scenario / run_id guards as `_frontier_provenance`, so it never attaches to a scenario frontier. `FrontierPlot.tsx` renders certification by **solidity** (certified points solid, the not-yet-certified field faded, dominated points faintest — opacity orthogonal to the role hue), with a provenance chip and a solid emerald-diamond overlay trace in the 2D/3D scatter; the ≥4-objective parallel-coordinates view can't overlay a second trace, so there certification rides on the chip plus greying the dominated lines. The `solution_interpreter` skill ("Denoting Certification — Prose & Tables") carries the same denotation into the agent's prose and tables.

**Response compaction** — `server.py/_format_explore` trims redundant bulk from explore output (e.g. strips option lists from extreme_solutions, restructures scenario_specific_options) to prevent MCP truncation while keeping the dict shape stable for consumers. `solve/run` responses are also compacted: full solution bodies are not returned inline — only objective ranges plus a preview (extremes + balanced by id/values), with a `next_steps` pointer to `explore` for full detail. The complete run payload (all solutions with allocations) is persisted to disk at `full_result_path` for bulk export and artifact assembly without token overhead.

### Long-running Solves (background jobs)

FastMCP runs a **synchronous** tool function *directly on the asyncio event loop* (`mcp.server.fastmcp` calls `fn(...)` for a sync tool, only `await`ing async ones). Frontier's tools are sync `def`s, so a long `optimize()` — a `thorough` NSGA run, an exact scalarization sweep, or a large problem — would block the whole server (no pings/keepalive, no concurrent calls) *and* overrun the client's per-tool-call timeout, killing the turn before the solve returns. Making the tools `async` is not an option: the function is the same object the test suite (~117 call sites) invokes synchronously, and `@mcp.tool()` returns it unchanged.

So `solve run` / `run_scenarios` **dispatch the heavy optimize+persist to a background worker thread** (`server.py`: a module-level `ThreadPoolExecutor` + a `{job_id → SolveJob}` registry, mirroring the existing module-level injection state) and wait inline only a short budget (`FRONTIER_SOLVE_WAIT_SECONDS`, ~10 s). If the solve finishes in time it returns the full result — fast solves stay synchronous, so existing behavior and tests are unchanged. Otherwise it returns a `{status:"running", job_id}` handle and the worker runs on; the agent polls **`solve status`** until `complete`. Validation and solver-resolution stay inline (immediate errors); only the optimize runs in the worker. The `solution_interpreter` injection moves to *delivery* time (the inline-complete return or the `status` return), always on a request thread, so the once-per-problem throttle stays single-threaded.

Two correctness properties make backgrounding safe:
- **Persisted by the worker.** The worker writes the run to the store before signalling done, so the frontier survives even an interrupted poll — `explore` works the moment `status` reports `complete`.
- **Safe persistence under concurrency.** `Store.save` is **atomic** (temp file + `os.replace`), so a reader never sees a torn file. Before attaching its run, the worker re-loads the problem **under a process write lock** and compares a **structural fingerprint** (objectives, options, scores, constraints, approach, interaction matrices, scenarios) against the dispatch snapshot: if the solve-inputs changed *during* the solve it reports `stale` and writes nothing rather than clobbering the edit (non-solve edits — curation, a rename — don't trip it, and the same gate covers the infeasible result so a mid-solve edit isn't reported as a stale "infeasible"). The lock serializes concurrent background solves on the *same* problem — the normal *run NSGA, then run an exact overlay* flow — so the two runs can't lose each other. The one residual window is a foreground edit committing inside the worker's brief locked finalize; it isn't reachable under today's single-client serial-call model, and the full hardening is to take the same lock in the foreground mutators.

Determinism is unaffected: the optimizer's seeded-RNG shim is thread-local (`optimize_scenarios` already runs solves off-thread the same way), so a seeded run reproduces identically whether it completes inline or in a worker. `time_limit` (above) composes with this — a long *bounded* run still backgrounds, then returns its `time_limited` best-so-far. *Deferred:* fine-grained live progress (gen *i/N*) and a `solve cancel` action (both would thread a progress/stop callback through the optimizer and both exact backends); coarse progress (`elapsed_s` + a phase `label`) ships today. A future option for multi-client/SSE deployments is to register an async tool-wrapper so even the brief inline wait never occupies the loop.

### Evaluation Framework

Frontier has been validated with structured comparison runs — Frontier vs LLM-only vs a classical pymoo/pyomo solver — across portfolio-optimization scenarios (base and multi-scenario). Each run produces per-approach results, curated picks, an issues log, and a synthesizing `comparison.md`, plus generated plots (pairwise clouds, return-vol annotations, strategy migration). These runs evidence the gap Frontier closes between unaided LLM reasoning and structured optimization. The eval harness is a development tool and lives outside the published repository.

## 5. Web UI & Hosting

An optional web app ([`ui/`](ui/)) is the **visualize** surface — a thin chat shell over the same MCP engine, for users not in a coding-agent MCP client. It adds no domain logic: workflow behavior still flows from the engine's tool descriptions, `instructions`, auto-injected skills, and the `viz_data` payloads above.

**Pluggable agent runtime** — `ui/lib/agent-runtime.ts` selects a backend via the `AGENT_BACKEND` env var. All adapters normalize to one Anthropic-shaped SSE wire format (`mcp_tool_use` / `mcp_tool_result` content blocks), so the UI is identical across them and provider lock-in is bounded to that single file.

| `AGENT_BACKEND` | Status | MCP loop | Engine reachability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messages-api` (prod default) | working | Anthropic server-side MCP connector | needs a public https engine (Anthropic calls it) |
| `anthropic-local` (local default) | working | client-side, inside the web app | works with localhost or a gated engine |
| `openai-compatible` | working | client-side | any OpenAI Chat-Completions provider |
| `managed-agents`, `agent-sdk` | stub | — | — |

**Design invariants:**
- **Thin system prompt, behavior fetched from the engine** (`ui/lib/system-prompt.ts`) — no skill/workflow content is *hardcoded* in the UI. Each adapter fetches the engine's MCP `instructions` (the canonical workflow + framing guidance) and folds them into the system prompt: `anthropic-local` / `openai-compatible` get them from their MCP client, and `messages-api` fetches them over a short-lived authenticated client (cached) because the Anthropic connector does **not** surface the `instructions` field. The prompt file itself holds only identity + web-UI-specific *presentation* directives (e.g. render charts, don't echo the engine's ASCII visualizations) that by definition can't live in the shared engine. Domain/workflow fixes still belong in the engine, never the prompt.
- **Direct SSE, no AI SDK** — each `data: {…}` line is a raw Anthropic event; `ui/lib/stream-reducer.ts` folds them into message state incrementally. It addresses content blocks by the server-assigned `index` (which counts thinking blocks the UI doesn't store), never by array position — position-based addressing misroutes every delta after a thinking block, leaving empty text blocks the API rejects on the next turn (`text content blocks must be non-empty`). The same module strips internal fields and drops empty text blocks when building the round-trip payload.
- **Clean assistant rendering** (`ui/app/page.tsx`, `ui/components/Viz/`) — the chat surfaces only the model's prose, markdown tables, and charts drawn from each `tool_result`'s `viz_data` (frontier scatter/3D and the per-scenario overlay via Plotly, compare parallel-coords and marginal rates via D3, scenario summary and formulation as cards). Raw tool-call input/result JSON is **not** rendered, and the engine's ASCII visualizations are stripped if the model echoes them — the value-add over the coding-agent MCP surface is a clean, chart-first view.
- **Ephemeral sessions** — a random `problem_id` per session (pre-D.1 multi-tenancy); refreshing the page starts a new one.

**Hosting & auth** — [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) provisions both services (engine + web UI) and is the OSS deploy path. There are **two independent gates**, both shared-secret and both open-when-unset (local dev / self-host):

- **Engine gate** — a shared `FRONTIER_MCP_TOKEN` (auto-generated as a Render env group, injected into both services) gates the public engine: the web app forwards it on the connector call (`authorization_token`), and direct MCP-client users send it as an `Authorization: Bearer` header. Enforced by an ASGI bearer check in `mcp_server/server.py` over the `/sse`, `/messages`, and `/mcp` paths.
- **Web UI gate** — a shared `UI_ACCESS_PASSWORD` gates the web app itself via HTTP Basic Auth (`ui/middleware.ts`), covering the page *and* `/api/chat`. This is necessary because the engine token authenticates the *app→engine* call and is never exposed to UI users — so without its own gate the hosted UI would be open to anyone with the URL (and would spend the operator's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

Per-user identity (`owner_id` scoping, real per-user accounts) is the next step (D.1); today every session shares one problem namespace, which is acceptable for a trusted closed beta.
