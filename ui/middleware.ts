/**
 * Shared-password gate for the hosted web UI (HTTP Basic Auth).
 *
 * Covers the page and every API route — /api/chat and /api/render alike (the
 * matcher excludes only Next internals) — the APIs must be gated too, or a request
 * could hit chat and spend the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or render and spend engine
 * compute, straight past the page gate. This is distinct
 * from the engine's FRONTIER_MCP_TOKEN: that token authenticates the app→engine
 * connector call and is never exposed to UI users, so the UI needs its own gate.
 *
 * Open when UI_ACCESS_PASSWORD is unset in development (local / single-user
 * self-host). In production the gate fails CLOSED: an unset password makes the
 * app refuse to serve (503) rather than run unauthenticated, since an open
 * public deploy lets anyone with the URL spend the operator's ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
 * and drive engine compute.
 * Username is optional: unset UI_ACCESS_USER = any username + correct password.
