# Capital project selection (120 projects)

Pick which of 120 capital projects to fund, maximizing total NPV and strategic value while holding down total cost and risk exposure, under a hard $610M budget with per-category caps, dependencies, mutual exclusions, and a portfolio-size range (18–40). Binary (each project in or out), 4 objectives, combinatorial constraints: at this scale the exact-MILP frontier covers materially more of the tradeoff surface than a fixed-resolution metaheuristic, the canonical explore-fast-then-certify showcase.

- **`problem.json`**: 4 objectives (NPV and StrategicFit maximize, Cost and Risk minimize, all `sum` totals), binary approach, and the combinatorial constraints (budget, category caps, dependencies, exclusions, portfolio-size range).
- **`scores.json`**: the 120 projects scored on each objective.
- **`solutions.json`**: the exploratory NSGA `run` plus the exact-MILP `exact_run` overlay (HiGHS or cuOpt).

Load with `model load source="capital_project_selection_120"`, or paste this to an agent connected to Frontier:

> Help me decide which of these 120 projects to fund. Show me my real choices within the $610M budget, how much to trust them, and walk me through a few plans worth defending.

## The workflow

1. **Solve** (`solve run`): the optimizer produces the NPV/cost/risk/strategic-fit frontier of funding plans.
2. **Explore the tradeoffs** (`explore tradeoffs`): the extremes, a balanced plan, and the knees.
3. **Certify and examine** (`solve solver="highs"` or `"cuopt"` → `explore certify` → `explore sensitivity`): the exact MILP overlay returns the optimal subset per scalarization and audits which heuristic points it dominates (the headline step at 120 binary options, reclaiming tradeoff surface a fixed-resolution metaheuristic misses); integer selections carry no solver duals, so the examine falls back to the frontier-inferred binding analysis (which caps and the budget bind).
4. **Decide** (`explore curate`): pin a few funding plans and commit on the tradeoffs.

**Aggregation note.** All four objectives are totals (`sum`): a capital *deployment* decision wants the most total value the budget buys, with the binding budget and caps mediating portfolio size. Per-project *quality* (average strategic-fit or risk *level*) would be `avg`, which answers a different fixed-size question and falls outside the exact-MILP's linear scope. For `avg` / `quadratic` aggregation on a continuous shape, see [`investment_portfolio`](../investment_portfolio/).
