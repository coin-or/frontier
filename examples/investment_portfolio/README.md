# Investment portfolio

A 30-ETF portfolio balancing return, volatility (via covariance), and yield, across three macro scenarios. The quadratic mean-variance objective makes the exact path a QP: the full Frontier workflow on a continuous problem with stress testing.

- **`problem.json`**: 3 objectives (Return / Volatility / Yield), proportional approach, constraints (single-fund ≤30%, ≤3 per sector, volatility ≤20%), and three macro scenarios (`recession`, `inflation`, `rate_cuts`).
- **`scores.json`**: the 30 funds, their per-objective scores, and the covariance matrix (the `Volatility` interaction matrix).
- **`solutions.json`**: the exploratory NSGA `run` plus the per-scenario `scenario_run`.

Load with `model load source="investment_portfolio"`, then drive it the way a user would — one ask per phase, with the tools that fire and what to expect:

## The workflow

1. *“How should we allocate? Show me the return/risk/yield tradeoffs, and how the picture changes in a recession, an inflation run, or rate cuts.”*
   `solve run` + `solve run_scenarios` → `explore tradeoffs` + `explore scenario_frontiers`: the covariance-based frontier (sector caps binding) plus one frontier per macro regime.
2. *“Keep the balanced portfolio and the calmest one. Are these optimal, or just decent?”*
   `explore curate` per pick (the proportional quality checks are live — concentration, cap-pinning) → `solve solver="highs"` → `explore certify`: the exact mean-variance QP overlay, sharpest at the volatility corner.
3. *“At the balanced portfolio, which of my rules is costing me the most — and which allocations hold up across all three macro futures?”*
   `explore sensitivity` → `explore scenario_results`: solver-exact duals — Yield the costlier axis to push (~+57 vs Return ~+17), the Return shadow price falling ~51→0 along the frontier, GLD the closest near-miss, HYG pinned at its 30% cap — then robustness tiers, scenario risk, and per-scenario `varies`/`held_fixed`.
4. *“Write the shortlist up for the investment committee.”*
   `explore curated format="markdown"`: the handoff table with per-finalist quality.

**Scope.** Exact duals cover the continuous mean-variance (QP) shape; integer/MILP selection problems carry none, falling back to the frontier-inferred estimate (`source=frontier_inferred`).
