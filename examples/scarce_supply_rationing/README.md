# Scarce supply rationing

Split one quarter's constrained memory-chip supply across 36 customers whose committed demand runs ~1.8× what the fabs will deliver — every plan cuts someone, and the question is what protecting each account costs. Distributors pay spot (top revenue per share, near-zero strategic weight, fragile demand); hyperscale and tier-1 contracts pay less but carry the relationships — and the **contractual minimum shares** — the board protects. Proportional, purely linear (exact multi-objective **LP** with duals), and the per-option allocation-floor showcase: a single-objective Solver run lands on the max-revenue corner with the strategic mandate pinned at its floor, blind to the +22% strategic value the frontier offers for a 6% revenue concession.

- **`problem.json`**: 3 objectives (Revenue / StrategicValue maximize, DemandFragility minimize, all `sum`), proportional approach, constraints (8% anti-concentration cap; **per-customer floors** HYP-01 ≥ 6%, HYP-02 ≥ 5%, HYP-03 ≥ 4%, IND-01 ≥ 4%, IND-02 ≥ 3% — contractual minimums; credit caps on DST-01 and DST-02; a StrategicValue ≥ 4.8 board mandate), and two scenarios: `fab_outage` (**the floors rise** — same absolute commitments, ~25% less supply, so 6/5/4/4/3 become 8/7/5/5/4 as shares) and `spot_surge` (distributor Revenue +35%).
- **`scores.json`**: the 36 customers scored per 1% of supply, segment economics doing the conflict work.
- **`solutions.json`**: the exploratory NSGA `run`, the exact-LP `exact_run` overlay with solver duals, and the per-scenario `scenario_run`.

Load with `model load source="scarce_supply_rationing"`, then drive it the way a user would — one ask per phase, with the tools that fire and what to expect:

## The workflow

1. *“How could we split this quarter's supply? Show me the real tradeoffs between revenue, the strategic accounts, and demand we can't count on — and what happens if the fab outage hits or spot prices spike.”*
   `solve run` + `solve run_scenarios` → `explore tradeoffs` + `explore scenario_frontiers`: the rationing frontier plus both shocks — `fab_outage` restates the whole constraint set with *raised* floors (6/5/4/4/3 → 8/7/5/5/4: same commitments, less supply), and the distributor segment absorbs it (average share 13.9% → 13.2%).
2. *“Keep the balanced split and the one that maximizes revenue. Are these optimal, or just plausible?”*
   `explore curate` per pick (floored accounts read as pinned at the revenue corner — that's the story, not a defect) → `solve solver="highs"` → `explore certify`: the exact multi-objective-LP overlay; every point honors the floors and the mandate — the max-revenue corner sits *at* the mandate (4.84 vs 4.8).
3. *“At the revenue-max split, what is each of our commitments costing — the board's mandate and every contract floor? Which would I renegotiate first?”*
   `explore sensitivity` at the revenue corner (`source="exact"`): the mandate priced as a `model_bound` lever, **`floored_options`** giving each contract floor's price per point of allocation, near-misses, and `suggested_scenarios`. Duals rank, scenarios quantify — price a real renegotiation with a re-solve.
4. *“If the fab outage happens, who absorbs the cut? Write up the recommendation for the allocation committee.”*
   `explore scenario_results` (robustness tiers, per-scenario `varies`/`held_fixed` — name who shrinks, not just how much) → `explore curated format="markdown"`: lead with the floor prices — the mandate and the contracts are the levers management can renegotiate.

**Differentiation note.** [`production_mix`](../production_mix/) and [`budget_allocation`](../budget_allocation/) are the LP-duals siblings for *deploying* capacity you have; this is the rationing shape — demand exceeds supply, floors encode promises already made, and the scenario moves the *constraints* (commitments as shares) rather than the scores. The per-option floors are `allocation_bound` constraints, priced on the exact path; for the QP flavor of proportional allocation see [`supplier_selection`](../supplier_selection/).
