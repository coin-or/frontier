# Claims investigation triage

**The decision.** Pick which of 180 model-flagged claims a special-investigations unit works this month, maximizing expected recovery while holding down investigator hours and the friction of investigating customers who turn out clean. A 1,170-hour capacity (nine investigators), a $4.84M recovery target, per-line concentration caps, and six regulator-mandated referrals couple every pick to every other: the best recovery-per-hour ratios sit on borderline claims where friction accrues, so a ratio ranking breaches the Auto cap (57 picks against a cap of 38) and pays 429 friction points where the frontier meets the same target at 313.

**Why Frontier.** At 2^180 candidate plans this is far past any spreadsheet; binary, all-`sum` objectives — the full explore → certify arc — and the **`explore audit` governance showcase**: prove what holds across *every* feasible plan, not just the frontier.

**What ships here** — the raw inputs (step 1), the canonical model they frame into, and pre-solved results:

- **`data.csv`**: the raw inputs a decision owner would actually have — everything step 1 pastes.
- **`problem.json`**: 3 objectives (ExpectedRecovery maximize, Hours / Friction minimize, all `sum`), binary approach, the coupled constraints (1,170-hour cap, $4,840k recovery floor, per-line caps Auto 38 / Property 32 / Liability 28 / Workers' comp 26, portfolio 45–100, six `force_include` referrals), and the `capacity_cut` scenario (a CAT deployment drops capacity to 1,140 hours).
- **`scores.json`**: the 180 claims scored per objective — framed as the output of an upstream fraud-scoring model, so shaky scores are part of the story (see the data_collection skill).
- **`solutions.json`**: the exploratory NSGA `run`, the exact-MILP `exact_run` overlay, and the per-scenario `scenario_run`.

## The runbook

1. **Frame it from the raw inputs** — paste this ask, together with `data.csv`, into a fresh session:

   > Our special-investigations unit needs this month's triage list. `data.csv` has the 180
   > model-flagged claims: expected recovery ($k), investigator hours, and a customer-friction
   > score per claim, plus its line of business and whether it's a regulator-mandated
   > referral. Four big-ticket claims dominate the book — PRP-1001, LIA-1001, PRP-1002, and
   > WC-1001 — none of them among the mandated referrals.
   >
   > The decision is which claims to open — each is in or out. Maximize total expected
   > recovery; minimize total hours and total friction.
   >
   > Hard rules:
   > - Nine investigators give us at most 1,170 hours this month.
   > - The quarterly plan requires at least $4,840k of expected recovery.
   > - Work between 45 and 100 claims.
   > - Per-line concentration caps: at most 38 Auto (AUT), 32 Property (PRP),
   >   28 Liability (LIA), and 26 Workers' comp (WC) claims.
   > - The six mandated referrals (marked in the CSV) must be worked.
   >
   > One future to stress-test:
   > - **Capacity cut** — a catastrophe event pulls investigators onto CAT duty: capacity
   >   drops to 1,140 hours; the recovery target and every other rule stay as-is.

   Framing that input (`model create` + `model update`) lands on exactly this problem — the ask plus the data reconstruct `problem.json` and `scores.json` verbatim (guarded by `tests/test_upstream_kits.py`). `model load source="claims_investigation_triage"` is the shortcut: it skips framing and restores the pre-solved runs too.

2. *“Which claims should we work this month? Show me my real choices across recovery, hours, and how much we'd annoy legitimate customers — and how the picture changes if the CAT event pulls one of my seniors.”*
   `solve run` + `solve run_scenarios` → `explore tradeoffs`: the frontier over 2^180 plans (at the recovery target, friction spans ~328 to ~388 — the axis a recovery-per-hour ranking can't see; the step-3 exact overlay widens the endpoints to ~313–417) plus the `capacity_cut` scenario frontier; the hours capacity and the Auto line cap bind.
3. *“Keep the balanced plan and the gentlest one that still hits the target. How much should I trust these?”*
   `explore curate` per pick → `solve solver="highs" exact=true` → `explore certify`: the zero-gap certified MILP overlay — its dominance audit is the scale story at 180 binary options — plus coverage, the invariant, and quality gates.
4. *“Is there any legal plan that skips the regulator referrals or any of the four big-ticket claims? And is LIA-1002 covered too?”*
   `explore audit` with a LIST of ten force_include properties: verdict `holds` with a per-property breakdown — a proof over the whole feasible space in one call. Only six are mandated; the four whales are forced by *arithmetic* (see the emergence note). Audit LIA-1002 alone and it flips to `violated`, with a concrete plan that skips it.
5. *“What's holding us back, what should we stress-test next quarter, and write this up for the claims committee.”*
   `explore sensitivity` (frontier-inferred binding analysis + `suggested_scenarios` — no MILP duals) → `explore curated format="markdown"`: lead the writeup with the audited guarantee, since it holds whichever finalist is picked.

**Emergence note.** The audit's headline guarantee is *not* a restatement of a constraint. Nothing in the model forces the four whales — drop any one and the remaining book tops out below the $4,840k floor inside 1,170 hours, so their inclusion is a *theorem* of the constraint set, provable only by reasoning over the whole feasible region. That's what `explore audit` adds beyond reading the frontier: every frontier plan happening to include a claim is an observation; `holds` is a proof. For the same binary MILP arc at portfolio scale, see [`capital_project_selection_300`](../capital_project_selection_300/); for what audit can't do here (a quadratic objective blocks nothing, but a *bound* on one would), see [`charging_network_siting`](../charging_network_siting/).
