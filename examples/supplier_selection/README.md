# Supplier selection

Split a production order across 25 global suppliers balancing cost, reliability, lead time, ESG risk, and correlated regional disruption: the cheap suppliers are slower, less reliable, and riskier, and the per-region caps plus the quadratic concentration term make it too combinatorial for a spreadsheet or an LLM alone. The minimize-risk quadratic puts it on Frontier's exact mean-variance (QP) path.

- **`problem.json`**: 5 objectives (Cost / LeadTime / ESGRisk / ConcentrationRisk minimize, Reliability maximize; ConcentrationRisk is quadratic), proportional approach, constraints (≤15% per supplier, ≤3 active suppliers per region, weighted reliability ≥78), and two scenarios (`china_disruption`, `demand_surge`).
- **`scores.json`**: 25 suppliers across 6 regions with per-objective scores, plus the `ConcentrationRisk` interaction matrix (high within-region correlation, ~0 across regions).
- **`solutions.json`**: the exploratory NSGA `run` plus the per-scenario `scenario_run`.

Load with `model load source="supplier_selection"`, then drive it the way a user would — one ask per phase, with the tools that fire and what to expect:

## The workflow

1. *“How should we split the order across these 25 suppliers, keeping regional concentration in check? Show me the real cost/reliability/lead-time/ESG choices — and how they hold up if China goes offline or demand surges.”*
   `solve run` + `solve run_scenarios` → `explore tradeoffs`: the five-objective sourcing frontier plus per-scenario frontiers for `china_disruption` (those suppliers offline) and `demand_surge` (per-supplier capacity tightens to 10%).
2. *“Keep the balanced mix and the most reliable one. Are these actually optimal?”*
   `explore curate` per pick → `solve solver="highs"` → `explore certify`: the exact mean-variance QP overlay, sharpest at the minimum-concentration-risk corner.
3. *“Which of our rules costs us the most, and which supplier just missed the cut?”*
   `explore sensitivity`: solver-exact duals — whether a region cap or the reliability floor is the binding lever, the closest near-miss supplier, and which sit pinned at a cap.
4. *“Write it up for the sourcing review.”*
   `explore curated format="markdown"`: the handoff table.
